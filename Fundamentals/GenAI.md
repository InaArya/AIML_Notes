# What is Gen AI?
Generative AI or generative artificial intelligence refers to the use of AI to create new content, like text, images, music, audio, and videos.

Generative AI is powered by foundation models (large AI models) that can multi-task and perform out-of-the-box tasks, including summarization, Q&A, classification, and more. Plus, with minimal training required, foundation models can be adapted for targeted use cases with very little example data. 

# How does generative AI work?
Generative AI works by using an ML model to learn the patterns and relationships in a dataset of human-created content. It then uses the learned patterns to generate new content. 

The most common way to train a generative AI model is to use supervised learning - the model is given a set of human-created content and corresponding labels. It then learns to generate content that is similar to the human-created content and labeled with the same labels.

# Common generative AI applications
- Improve customer interactions through enhanced chat and search experiences 
- Explore vast amounts of unstructured data through conversational interfaces and summarizations 
- Assist with repetitive tasks like replying to requests for proposals (RFPs), localizing marketing content in five languages, and checking customer contracts for compliance, and more

# Use cases:
Can craft human like text, useful for Content creation, copywrite, programming
Forms realistic images  such as artworks, designs or even human faces. Useful in graphic design, gaming and entertainment
Can compose music or generate new sounds, useful in music industry, film and sound
Generates molecular structure of new drugs, useful for medical discovery

# What is Data Augmentation?
Data augmentation is the process of artificially generating new data from existing data, primarily to train new machine learning (ML) models. Data augmentation artificially increases the dataset by making small changes to the original data. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) solutions are now being used for high-quality and fast data augmentation in various industries.
