# What is Gen AI?
Generative AI or generative artificial intelligence refers to the use of AI to create new content, like text, images, music, audio, and videos.

Generative AI is powered by foundation models (large AI models) that can multi-task and perform out-of-the-box tasks, including summarization, Q&A, classification, and more. Plus, with minimal training required, foundation models can be adapted for targeted use cases with very little example data. 

# How does generative AI work?
Generative AI works by using an ML model to learn the patterns and relationships in a dataset of human-created content. It then uses the learned patterns to generate new content. 

The most common way to train a generative AI model is to use supervised learning - the model is given a set of human-created content and corresponding labels. It then learns to generate content that is similar to the human-created content and labeled with the same labels.

# Common generative AI applications
- Improve customer interactions through enhanced chat and search experiences 
- Explore vast amounts of unstructured data through conversational interfaces and summarizations 
- Assist with repetitive tasks like replying to requests for proposals (RFPs), localizing marketing content in five languages, and checking customer contracts for compliance, and more
