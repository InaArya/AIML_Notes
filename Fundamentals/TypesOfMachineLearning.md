3 types of ML - Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement

# Supervised Learning - 
- employs human supervision to accurately label and train algorithms. 
- the machine is trained with the help of labeled input and output data to analyze the training data and predict accurate outcomes for new and unseen data
- past data is used to train the algorithm to categorize file types, such as images, words, and documents, and then predict outcomes by learning the new data via learning patterns.
- beneficial for collecting and producing data output and helps solve real-world computation queries

Two types-  Regression & Classification

Regression -  used to predict the output for real or continuous values
Classification - process of categorizing a given set of input data into classes based on one or more variables

# Unsupervised
- To build a concise representation of the data and generate imaginative content from it.

Types of Unsupervised - Clustering
Clustering - involve grouping untagged data based on their similarities and differences. When two instances appear in different groups, we can infer they have dissimilar properties. 

# Reinforcement
Trains software to make decisions to achieve the most optimal results. It mimics the trial-and-error learning process that humans use to achieve their goals. 
Let’s understand the RL mechanism with the help of an example.

Let’s assume you intend to teach your pet (dog) certain tricks.

As your pet cannot interpret our language, we need to adopt a different strategy.
We design a situation where the pet performs a specific task and offer a reward (such as a treat) to the pet.
Now, whenever the pet faces a similar situation, it tries to perform the same action that had previously earned him the reward with more enthusiasm.
The pet thereby ‘learns’ from its rewarding experiences and repeats the actions as it now knows ‘what to do’ when a particular situation arises.
On similar lines, the pet also becomes aware of the things to avoid if it encounters a specific situation.

# Supervised vs Unsupervised
Supervised 
- Highly accurate and reliable
- Simpler method
- Number of classes is known
- A desired output value (also called the supervisory signal)

Unsupervised
- Less accurate and reliable.
- Computationally complex.
- Number of classes is unknown.
- No corresponding output values
