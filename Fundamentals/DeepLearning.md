# What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. Deep learning models can recognize complex patterns in pictures, text, sounds, and other data to produce accurate insights and predictions. You can use deep learning methods to automate tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as describing images or transcribing a sound file into text.

# Why is deep learning important?
Artificial intelligence (AI) attempts to train computers to think and learn as humans do. Deep learning technology drives many AI applications used in everyday products, such as the following:

Digital assistants
Voice-activated television remotes
Fraud detection
Automatic facial recognition
It is also a critical component of emerging technologies such as self-driving cars, virtual reality, and more. 

Deep learning models are computer files that data scientists have trained to perform tasks using an algorithm or a predefined set of steps. Businesses use deep learning models to analyze data and make predictions in various applications.

# use cases of deep learning
automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, electronics, medical research etc
