## Data:
# Quantitative:
•	Data that can be counted or measured in numerical values
•	Ex: Height in feet, age in years, and weight in pounds

# Types:
 
# Nominal 
A nominal scale describes a variable with categories that do not have a natural order or ranking. You can code nominal variables with numbers if you want, but the order is arbitrary and any calculations, such as computing a mean, median, or standard deviation, would be meaningless.
Examples of nominal variables include: genotype, blood type, zip code, gender, race, eye color, political party

# Ordinal
An ordinal scale is one where the order matters but not the difference between values.Examples of ordinal variables include:  
socio economic status (“low income”,”middle income”,”high income”), education level (“high school”,”BS”,”MS”,”PhD”), income level (“less than 50K”, “50K-100K”, “over 100K”), satisfaction rating (“extremely dislike”, “dislike”, “neutral”, “like”, “extremely like”).


# Qualitative:
•	Data representing information and concepts that are not represented by numbers.
•	Ex: Maps, Photographs, Gender, Geography

# Types

# Interval
An interval scale is one where there is order and the difference between two values is meaningful.
Examples of interval variables include:
temperature (Farenheit), temperature (Celcius), pH, SAT score (200-800), credit score (300-850).

# Ratio
A ratio variable, has all the properties of an interval variable, and also has a clear definition of 0.0. When the variable equals 0.0, there is none of that variable.

Examples of ratio variables include:
enzyme activity, dose amount, reaction rate, flow rate, concentration, pulse, weight, length, temperature in Kelvin (0.0 Kelvin really does mean “no heat”), survival time.
When working with ratio variables, but not interval variables, the ratio of two measurements has a meaningful interpretation. For example, because weight is a ratio variable, a weight of 4 grams is twice as heavy as a weight of 2 grams. However, a temperature of 10 degrees C should not be considered twice as hot as 5 degrees C. If it were, a conflict would be created because 10 degrees C is 50 degrees F and 5 degrees C is 41 degrees F. Clearly, 50 degrees is not twice 41 degrees.  Another example, a pH of 3 is not twice as acidic as a pH of 6, because pH is not a ratio variable.

# Population vs Sample
Population is the entire set of items from which you draw data for a statistical study. It can be a group of individuals, a set of items, etc. It makes up the data pool for a study.
•	An example of a population would be the entire student body at a school. It would contain all the students who study in that school at the time of data collection
Sample is defined as a smaller and more manageable representation of a larger group. A subset of a larger population that contains characteristics of that population.
•	unbiased subset of the population that best represents the whole data.

Samples are used when :
•	The population is too large to collect data.
•	The data collected is not reliable.
•	The population is hypothetical and is unlimited in size.
