Mean median mode and range all calculate the averages of data sets

# Mean
Mean is the average of all of the numbers.
Add all of the numbers together and then divide that by how many numbers there are.

Mean - (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5

# Median
Median is the middle number, when in order.
Statistical tool that helps us find the most repeated value easily

The median is the number in the middle of a data set. For example, in the data set: 7, 6, 9, 2, 1, the median would be 6 as the numbers would be placed in order (1, 2, 6, 7, 9), and 6 is the number in the middle.
In the above, place the numbers in order and then find median.

If nums are odd: (n+1)th /2 
If nums are even: [(n/2)+ ((n/2)+1)]/2 
Ex: (1,3.4,6.7,7)  = (4+6) /2

# Mode
Mode is the most common number.
1,2,3,3,5,2,1,3
Here, mode is 3 -> the most common number

Mode = L + (f1-  f02f1-  f0-   f2 ) h

Here h Is the size of class interval
L is the lower limit of the class interval of modal class
f1  is the modal class frequency
f0 is the preceding class frequency 
f2 is the succeeding class frequency

Let us take an example to understand how to calculate the frequency of grouped data.

Class Interval

![Class Interval	Frequency(No of students)
0-10	2
10-20	4
20-30	8
30-40	5
40-50	6
Total	25

]

The above table represents the marks obtained by 25 students in mathematics examination

The class interval 20-30 has the highest frequency 8, thus the modal class is 20-30

From the modal class we have, L= 20  , f1 = 8 , f0 = 4 and f2 = 5

h = upper limit â€“ lower limit 

=>  h = 10 

Putting these values in the formula,  Mode = L + (f1-  f02f1-  f0-   f2 ) h

We will get, mode = 20 +( 8-42X 8-4-5  ) x 10

Mode = 20 + 47 x 10 =   25.71
